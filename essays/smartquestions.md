Smart Questions are important for Software Engineers because they are a necessary tool to communicate with sources to recieve answers to many problems.
Many software engineers will go through syntax and semantics errors. Many software engineers will go through interface errors. Doesn't matter if 
they are a software engineer for 2 years or 10 years, humans don't know everything. But what sets a good software engineer and a great software 
engineer apart is the ability to ask "good" questions

Good Questions require: preparation, the right attitude, and knowing where and how to ask. Just as Raymond and Moen shared, questions need preparation, 
they need the right grammar and wording with knowing what to say so the answer is direct as possible. A question without preparation and deep insight 
might be able to answered with a simple Google search. Knowing where and how to ask is also important. You wouldn't find an answer for a Python syntax error
in a Java manuel. Lastly, the right attitude is important. Communication is important for Software Engineer because a "good" question depends on what you say
and how you say it.


## A Smart Question

One example of a "smart" question is this question from Stack Overflow: 

<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74587029/by-pass-select-a-certificate-prompt-in-chrome-using-selenium-python" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
  Link to a Smart Question
</a>

It's a 'smart' question because the user had a problem with a certain portion of his code with Python in chrome. This user was prepared and formatted the
question for a direct answer. The user already looked on the web, tried previous solutions and failed, and now resulted in asking for a solution with
their previous code and errors that appear on his screen. Also, his question was presentable with good formating, which resulted with a couple developers
replying with answers.

## A Not So Smart Questions

One example of a not so smart question is this question also from Stack Overflow: 

<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79879161/call-a-key-in-python-dictionary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
  Link to a Not Smart Question
</a>

This question isn't a 'smart' questions for multiple reasons. This user asked a simple question on calling a certain index in a Python Dictonaries. This user 
was not prepared because this question can be simply answered with a simple google search or a quick search with Python Dictionaries. Also, this user has
formatting errors with words not spelt right, and some not used with capital letters. The unpreparedness of this user led to this question on Stack Overflow
leading to no replies and a couple of downvotes.

## My takeaway

Overall, this experience opened my eyes to the difference it makes when using smart questions. Also, it helped me to see how Stack Overflow 
can be used as an useful tool when growing my Sofware Engineering career. I can see myself using these smart questions and Stack Overflow more.
