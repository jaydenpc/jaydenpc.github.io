Software Engineering wasn't my first option but I'm glad I chose to stay in it. Originally in high school, I did Media and did an internship in 
broadcast media, filming, and editing video. I loved media but I knew that it wasn't something I wanted in a career. My love grew as I took computer science classes with AP Computer Science Principles and AP Computer Science A. I loved the freedom of being able to work on projects and being able to 
see others enjoy the websites, games, and webapps that I created. 

Currently, I have skills in Java, C, C++, Python, and I hope to sharpen my skills in TypeScript, CSS, and HTML. I want to see myself being more hands-on with projects in website, web-apps, and mobile apps. I love being able to see the vision of a big finished website or app and knowing that I was a developer whether it's making a component on the home page or data storage on the back end, and knowing I helped to create that for a company.

Some big obstacles within Software Engineering is definitely the workload. I love being able to spend hours on studying data structures or learning syntax for a new language but I definitely see that it's a huge time commitment. I know that we only get better if we consistently practice to sharpen our skills. To any beginner, Software Engineering can be seen as a stretch. For me, I see that through Software Engineering, I can see that it's open opportunity to hone my strengthens and lessen my weaknesses. 

Some big strengths within Software Engineering that I have seen throughout my career and classes are my peers and teamates. I feel strengthened knowing I have peers and professors to go to, when I have issues, bugs, or need a different set of eyes to give me clarity of vision. Also, I see how an important tool to have is visualization. Like when writing code, the best way when doing interview questions or practice coding questions, is to read carefully and digest the instructions and draw out different data structures. Like drawing trees and stacks is the only way that I can visualize to write code.

Overall, Software Engineering is a rigorous decision for a career, but it's rewarding. The time spent reviewing code, understanding pseudocode, writing comments is not time wasted. A wise person once said practice doesn't make perfection, it makes improvement .
